# Java_BankingApplication_Project
A simple Java-based banking application that demonstrates core programming concepts like object-oriented design, classes, methods, and basic operations. The project includes features such as account creation, deposit, withdrawal, and balance checking. Built as my first project to practice Java fundamentals and version control using GitHub.
